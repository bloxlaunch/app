## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is the source code private?**

**A:** To protect the integrity and originality of the project, the source code is kept private. This helps prevent unauthorised copying and ensures the app remains a unique and secure experience for everyone.

**Q: Can I use this with Bloxstrap?**

**A:** Yes. This is compatible with any Roblox bootstrapper 3rd party or not.

**Q: Do I have to login?**

**A:** No. You only have to be logged on the Roblox website in your default web browser.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No. It works the exact same way as launching a game from the Roblox website.

**Q: Who works on this project?**

**A:** Bloxlaunch is only developed and maintained by **[RobTosPro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0LTuTjV-WaudcRiyo9Xvw/featured)** (me :D)

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxlaunch](https://github.com/bloxlaunch/app/releases/latest), run it, and install. That's about it!

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxlaunch for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".
