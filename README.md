## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for me to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository and [bloxlaunch.com](https://bloxlaunch.com).

**Q: Can I use this with Bloxstrap?**

**A:** Yes. This is compatible with any Roblox bootstrapper 3rd party or not.

**Q: Do I have to login?**

**A:** No. You only have to be logged on the Roblox website in your default web browser, or sometimes on the official Roblox app.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No. It works the exact same way as launching a game from the Roblox website.

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxlaunch](https://github.com/bloxlaunch/app/releases/latest), run it, and install. That's about it!

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxlaunch for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".
